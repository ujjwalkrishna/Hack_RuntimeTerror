## About Our Website
Majority of hospitals in rural areas and towns or even in some cities don't have their own website and do not provide with services like online appointment booking.

Despite of an increase in number of smart phone users in India in last few years, patients have to wait in queues in clinics simply because the digital growth is not channelized.

Keeping this in mind, we have come with a project called 'Medicare' that aims at digitalization of small hospitals and clinics.

We provide details of various hospitals, their doctors, fee structure, lab test facilities, etc so that users can compare between various options and choose the one that serves them the best.

Our key features include appointment booking and lab test booking. By this features we aim to help clinics and hospitals that have not gone digital yet and connect with patients more effectively.

We aim to work with as many hospitals possible and benefit as many users as we can.

Our team is keen towards providing users with their best experience.
